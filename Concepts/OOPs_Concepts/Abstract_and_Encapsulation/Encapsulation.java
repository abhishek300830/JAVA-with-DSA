/*
Encapsulation is the wrapping of data and Methods  in single Unit 
by using  the concept of access Modifiers and classes and objects.


Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and 
code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes,
 and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class
